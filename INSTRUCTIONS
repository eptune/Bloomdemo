Your mission for this breakout session is to do the following:

1. Read the beginning of the file README for some context as to the
   purpose of the Python code you've just checked out. (You can
   skip the "Implementation" section and everything after it for now.)

2. Create and check out a new branch named "work" based on the current
   "master" branch of this repository.

3. Add a feature to the program "indict" that has it print out
   the false-positive rate of its filter algorithm. The code to
   compute this rate is already in place -- you just need to 
   hook up the printing part of things. (The target rate is 5%.)
   Briefly document the option in the file "README".

4. In the course of doing this, you should encounter an OBVIOUS
   bug in false-positive-rate code in the file "bloom.py". Fix it.
   (You don't need any understanding of the code to spot the bug.)

5. Update the version of the program listed at the top of the
   README to 2.0.

6. Commit your changes to the repository **as three separate
   commits**:

   - One commit fixing the false-positive-rate bug
   - One commit adding the new option and documenting it
     in the README
   - One commit bumping the version number at the top of the README

7. Merge your work back into the "master" branch.

8. Tag your latest master commit as "v2.0". Congratulations, you've
   made a software release!

If you run into problems, don't hesitate to ask for help -- Git
is a sharp tool and you can occasionally get your repository into 
a weird state if you start flailing. The standard commands are
pretty good about giving you sound advice, however.

If you finish with time to spare
========================================

Here are some things you could try investigating:

- Fool with around blowing away files and magically rescuing them
  via "git checkout".

- Which commit introduced the false-positive-rate bug? (Try "git
  blame")

- Explore the repository contents and history interactively and
  prettily with your web browser by visiting

  http://github.com/pkgwdemo/bloomdemo

- On a conceptual level, what changes were made between versions of
  1.0 and 2.0? ("git log")

- What is the full source-code "diff" between versions 1.0 and 2.0?
  ("git diff")

- Try using "git rebase -i" to re-patch the repository history
  so that the false-positive-rate bug is never introduced. What happens
  to the ID of the most recent commit after the rebase, and why?

- Create a few temporary branches to engineer a merge conflict, and
  resolve it.

- The very astute user will notice that the timestamps in the
  commit history of the repository do not proceed chronologically.
  What does that suggest about how I constructed the repository
  history?
